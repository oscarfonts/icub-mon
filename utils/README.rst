Various utilities for MCM data management
=========================================

**Warning:** Except for "database" scripts, all the rest are **outdated utilities**. Don't attempt to run them, they won't work. Keeping them here because they are part of the deliverables.

* database => Scripts to create and drop the MCM data model. Need to run the create_db script before running the api application.

* georeference => Insert a csv with x, y columns into a PostGIS geometry table.
* highlights => Import Africa highlights from an XLS file.
* lido => Import a set of LIDO files into the PostGIS model.
